# SAMI
ðŸš€ SAMI â€“ Custom Game Engine Project


SAMIENGINE is my personal journey into building a fully functional game engine from scratch.
Itâ€™s a work-in-progress engine designed to explore how modern rendering, entity systems, logging, and other core systems come together under the hood.

This is not just a codebase â€” itâ€™s a learning experience. I'm building this to understand:

ðŸ”§ How rendering pipelines really work

ðŸ§  How ECS (Entity Component System) can be implemented

ðŸ’¬ How to build flexible logging tools

ðŸŽ® And eventually: how a game engine ties all systems together into something playable
